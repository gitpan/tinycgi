            hi => 'say_hi'
        };
    
        sub index {

        }
    
        my $app = tinycgi->new->run;

DESCRIPTION
    More to come soon as I have big plans for this space. Basically I still
    write one-off cgi-scripts from time-to-time and deploy them in various
    environments. Sometimes dependencies are a problem, sometimes they're
    not, ... the point is I don't mind working in these evironments and
    writing cgi-scripts but I would like do so easily and more efficiently.

    So currently (hopefully not for long), tinycgi wraps CGI::Application
    and does a bunch of setup stuff for you. I have a bigger picture in mind
    but I don't care to dump it in POD atm, although it may look something
    like ....
